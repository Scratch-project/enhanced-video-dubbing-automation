# Enhanced Video Dubbing Automation Project Prompt

  

## Project Overview

I have a series of around 10 long-form videos, each lasting between 60 and 120 minutes. The videos are in Arabic, specifically the Egyptian dialect, and follow a lecture or presentation format. One main speaker talks for most of the video, with occasional questions or brief audience participation.

  

My goal is to dub the entire series into both English and German, while preserving the original voice and timing as much as possible. The final videos should be fully processed and ready to upload to YouTube, ideally including subtitles alongside the dubbed audio.

  

## **CRITICAL KAGGLE REQUIREMENTS**

- **Platform**: Kaggle Notebook with GPU acceleration (P100/T4/V100)

- **No Root Access**: Use `--user` installations and avoid system-level packages

- **Storage**: Work within `/kaggle/working/` and `/kaggle/input/` directories

- **Memory Management**: Handle GPU memory efficiently with model loading/unloading

- **Session Limits**: Design for 12-hour maximum session time with checkpointing

- **Internet**: Limited to specific whitelisted domains for model downloads

- **File Size**: Handle large video files (up to 8GB per video)

  

## **KAGGLE-SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION NOTES**

1. **Model Caching**: Cache all models in `/kaggle/working/models/` to avoid re-downloads

2. **Checkpoint System**: Save progress after each major step to resume interrupted sessions

3. **Memory Optimization**: Clear GPU memory between processing steps

4. **Batch Processing**: Process one video at a time to manage memory constraints

5. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for network timeouts and memory issues

6. **Progress Tracking**: Implement detailed logging for long-running processes

  

## **PACKAGE INSTALLATION STRATEGY**

```python

# Kaggle-compatible installation approach

!pip install --user package_name

# OR use conda when available

!conda install -c conda-forge package_name

```

# Final Video Dubbing Automation Workflow

  

## **Step 0: Environment Setup & Model Preparation**

* **Tools**: Kaggle-specific installations, model caching

* **Process**:

  * Install all required packages with `--user` flag

  * Download and cache all models (Whisper, SeamlessM4T, OpenVoice, SpeechBrain)

  * Set up proper CUDA environment and GPU memory allocation

  * Create working directory structure

  * Implement logging and checkpoint systems

  

## **Step 1: Pre-processing & Audio Extraction**

* **Tools**: `ffmpeg`, `noisereduce`, `pydub`, `scipy`

* **Process**:

  * Extract high-quality audio from video (48kHz WAV)

  * Apply noise reduction using spectral gating

  * Detect and separate speaker segments using energy-based VAD

  * Create clean audio segments for better transcription

  * Generate audio quality metrics for validation

  * **Kaggle-specific**: Handle large file processing with memory monitoring

  

## **Step 2: Enhanced Transcription with Speaker Diarization**

* **Tools**: `openai-whisper` (large-v3), `speechbrain` for speaker diarization

* **Process**:

  * Load Whisper model with GPU optimization

  * Transcribe with precise timestamps using Whisper large-v3 (Arabic language specified)

  * Apply speaker diarization using SpeechBrain's pretrained models

  * Identify and label main speaker vs. audience/questions

  * Clean and format transcription with proper sentence segmentation

  * Export timestamped transcript in JSON format with speaker labels

  * Create backup transcription files for quality control

  * **Kaggle-specific**: Implement chunked processing for long videos

  

## **Step 3: Translation with Meta SeamlessM4T v2**

* **Tools**: `transformers`, `facebook/hf-seamless-m4t-large`

* **Process**:

  * Load SeamlessM4T v2 model locally (cache in `/kaggle/working/models/`)

  * Filter segments to translate only main speaker content

  * Translate Arabic segments to English and German separately

  * Preserve context and presentation flow using batch processing

  * Maintain speaking patterns and natural flow suitable for dubbing

  * Apply post-processing to ensure translation quality

  * Generate separate translation files for both target languages

  * Include timing metadata from original transcription

  * **Kaggle-specific**: Handle HuggingFace model caching and GPU memory

  

## **Step 4: Voice Cloning & Synthesis with OpenVoice v2**

* **Tools**: `MyShell OpenVoice v2`, `torch`, `librosa`

* **Process**:

  * Clone OpenVoice v2 repository to `/kaggle/working/`

  * Extract multiple clean voice samples from source speaker

  * Initialize OpenVoice v2 model with Arabic base voice

  * Perform cross-lingual voice cloning (Arabic → English/German)

  * Synthesize dubbed audio for both target languages

  * Apply tone and style reference matching from original speaker

  * Generate audio segments with preserved timing structure

  * Maintain emotional inflection and speaking characteristics

  * Export synthesized audio with timestamp alignment data

  * **Kaggle-specific**: Handle GitHub repository cloning and model setup

  

## **Step 5: Intelligent Audio-Video Synchronization**

* **Tools**: `ffmpeg`, `librosa`, `dtw-python` (Dynamic Time Warping)

* **Process**:

  * Analyze original audio timing patterns and speech rate

  * Calculate length differences between original and dubbed audio

  * Use Dynamic Time Warping for intelligent alignment

  * Apply time-stretching using `librosa.effects.time_stretch` where needed
